  Air: {
    name: "Air",
    description:
      "Air represents the sky, the heavens, and the intangible. It is ceaseless in its change, but such change is too often unnoticed until the storm descends. It is an element of uncertainty."
  },
  Darkness: {
    name: "Darkness",
    description:
      "Darkness represents the hidden, the obfuscated, and the unseen. It is the fear of both being alone, and the terror that one might not be. It is an element of secrets."

  Earth: {
    name: "Earth",
    description:
      "Earth represents soil, rock, and stability. It is the clay in the potterâ€™s hand and the stone upon which she sits. It is an element of certainty."

  Fire: {
    name: "Fire",
    description:
      "Fire represents heat, passion, and dream. It is the unquenchable desire of all men, and the mirage they ever seek but can never grasp. It is an element of extremes."

  Ice: {
    name: "Ice",
    description:
      "Ice represents the cold, the unchanging, the cessation of all warmth and activity. And yet for all its stillness, ice remains brittle, easily shattered or melted away. It is an element of contradictions."

  Life: {
    name: "Life",
    description:
      "Life represents all living things, their inevitable end, and their equally-certain rebirth. It is cyclical, unescapable, and beautiful even in its tragedy. It is the element at the center of all others, forged of them and yet standing apart. Life is the hub around which the whole of the cosmos turns."
  },
  Light: {
    name: "Light",
    description:
      "Light represents revelation, ingenuity, and perception. From light we may view the world, and from its colors we forge our meaning. It is an element of truth."
  },
  Metal: {
    name: "Metal",
    description:
      "Metal represents strength, union, and endurance. From base iron can be forged unbreakable steel, and from tarnished ore can be forged brilliant gold. It is an element of harmony."

  Water: {
    name: "Water",
    description:
      "Water represents sea, change, and homogeneity. It is the ebb and flow of form, of emotion, and of time itself, and the balance to which all extremes return. It is an element of equilibrium."
