In order to be affected, the door must be capable of closing (e.g. an open archway without an actual door cannot be affected). The door or gate immediately closes and is then sealed shut and resists all efforts to open it; any creature in the doorway when this occurs is pushed out of it. Creatures can make an (Athleticism + Strength) vs. casting check in order to force the door open (which ends the spell if successful), or they can break through the door normally if desired. Wizard’s Seal gains a +4 bonus to resist being dispelled/removed."

It knows the exact location of any creature within 15’ that moved on their last turn (forced-movement counts, but Teleports do not). Creatures it can detect via this ability do not benefit from Concealment, Invisibility, or Stealth.\nRooted (passive): The tree is immune to forced movement, cannot be knocked prone, and cannot move for any reason, even if granted bonus movement speed. It’s a tree."

The target is allowed a Mind vs. casting check to resist this spell; if they are hit, they become compelled to act in a fashion specified by the caster. The orders cannot be suicidal or certain to result in the target’s death, and must affect the target’s behavior in some fashion; they cannot be commanded to perform specific tasks (thus, “Do not steal,” is a legitimate command, while “Fetch me a shrubbery,” is not). The command must be no longer than 10 words in length. If the target fails to obey the terms of the Judgment, they suffer a stacking drain that reduces all their attributes by 1 for each day they fail to obey. Once they begin obeying the command again, the drain is reduced by 1 per day; this drain cannot otherwise be removed unless the Judgment is removed. The Judgment is considered an Enchantment and has a +4 bonus to resist being removed. Note that this spell enforces the letter of the command, rather than the spirit, meaning that a clever target can subvert poorly-worded orders. This ritual requires 1g worth of ritual dye, which is used to draw the brand on the target (in some conspicuous place, such as the forehead, chest, or hand)."

The refuge itself is hidden away in some long-lost Shadow Realm and cannot be found by any other means; creatures within it are entirely immune to Divinations. The refuge is approximately 900’ square (30’ x 30’) and can be partitioned into rooms as the caster desires; she can shape the refuge however she wishes, within reason, and is not required to make a perfectly square dwelling. Creatures inside can see the exit normally and can pass through it at any time. The refuge can have windows (at the caster’s option), but they show naught but a featureless dark plain and sky outside (venturing outside is not recommended…). While within her refuge, the caster and all allies can recuperate and recover from exposure to the elements. The refuge is permanent, but only one can be created at a time.
