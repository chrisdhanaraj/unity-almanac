Decompose (spell, 1 AP): This spell can be cast on a nonliving body or food item to cause nature to reclaim it. A corpse immediately becomes overgrown with fungus and small plants, making it impossible to bring the victim back to life or to use the corpse for any other purpose (such as Necromancy spells). The corpse turns to compost within 24 hours and leaves no trace behind. A food item spoils immediately and turns into nothing more than sludge after a few hours.
Wilt (body spell attack, 1 AP): This spell causes a touched plant of Small Size or smaller or a touched animal of Tiny Size or smaller to wither and die if it fails the Body check. You monster.

Befoul
(spell, 1 minute)
Range: melee                Area of Effect: special                Duration: permanent
This spell causes up to (2 * casting check) touched edible objects or one plant of Large Size or smaller to become corrupted. Affected foodstuffs become putrescent, foul tasting and smelling, and obviously inedible. Any creature that persists in eating gains no nourishment and must make a Body check (against the casting check) or become nauseated, inflicting a -4 penalty to all checks and reducing their AP by 1. Affected plants quickly become diseased and brown, dying over the course of 1d6 hours. Plant-like Primordial creatures, such as dryads and wood elementals, can be attacked by this spell (treat as a Body spell attack that must be used from melee range, any Spacing); it deals 8 acid damage to them, rather than instant death.

Blackbow of Ruin
(summoning spell, 2 AP)
Range: melee        Area of Effect: single target        Duration: (casting check) minutes

The bow has the following statistics and persists for the full duration of the spell: Damage: 5 (acid), Range: 45’, Reload: 1 AP, Size: S, Melee Stats: (treat as Small-Size Club). The target can use her Ranged Weapons skill, or whatever skill was used to cast the spell, when attacking with the blackbow; its attack checks are modified by Intuition as normal for a ranged weapon. The Blackbow of Ruin gains a +2 bonus to hit targets in short range; in addition, any target hit by its attacks begins decaying for (2 +/- net hits) rounds and suffers 4 acid damage per round. If the target is incapacitated while decaying, they are dealt a Deathblow and, if killed, instantly dissolve to an indistinguishable mass.

Range: 30’ increment                Area of Effect: single target        Duration: instant
This spell diseases a target, causing them to suffer hallucinations chosen by the caster. This is considered an illusion with every sensory component; the caster can choose how the hallucination appears when she casts the spell, but cannot change it once the spell has been cast. At the start of each of their turns, any creature adjacent to them must make a Body check (against the casting check) or become diseased as well. If Fever Dream spreads to other creatures, they will witness the same illusion as the initial target. This spell is Subtle.

(enchantment spell, 1 minute)
Range: melee                Area of Effect: special                Duration: permanent
This spell corrupts one or more edible objects (at the caster’s option, it can infect a single item, such as an apple, or an entire banquet table worth of foodstuffs). Any creature that eats the food must make a Body check. If they fail, they become poisoned, which has no immediate effect. After 1 hour, they become sickened and suffer a -2 penalty to all checks. 1 hour after that, they must make a second Body check or suffer nausea, inflicting a -4 penalty to all checks and reducing AP by 1. On the 4th hour, they must make a 3rd Body check or fall unconscious. On the 5th hour, they must make a final (4th) Body check or die instantly. If an affected creature succeeds any of the Body checks, the poison halts its progression and ends after 1 day.
