Novice Incantations
Circle Against Scrying
(enchantment spell, 2 AP)
Range: melee                Area of Effect: 30’ radius                Duration: (casting check) hours
This spell protects a 30’ radius area (the caster can make it smaller if she desires); while that area is enchanted, all Divination effects directed at it or against creatures within automatically fail and provide no information. This spell can also be cast as a ritual; if this is done, the radius is increased to 150’ (though the caster can make it smaller if she wishes) and the duration becomes permanent. However, the ritual requires 1g worth of oils and offerings to spread in the affected area.


Dispel Magic
(spell attack, 2 AP)
Range: 30’ increment        Area of Effect: single target        Duration: instant
This spell attempts to remove any number of enchantments or spiritual conditions of the caster’s choice from the target; the Difficulty to remove any given effect is the casting check result used to create it.


Reflective Armor
(summoning spell, 2 AP)
Range: melee        Area of Effect: single target        Duration: (casting check) minutes
This spell protects a touched creature with a magical field that warps attacks made against them. This suit of magical Light Armor has the following statistics: Resistance: 0/0/0/0, Encumbrance: 0. Any attack that glances the affected target instead misses them and is reflected back against the original attacker. Area attacks can miss, but cannot be reflected. By spending 2 AP, the target can either dismiss or resummon the armor for the duration of the spell. Any target already wearing armor cannot be affected by this spell.


Repulsion Ward
(enchantment spell, 2 AP)
Range: melee                Area of Effect: 30’ radius                Duration: (casting check) hours
This spell lays a magical trap in a target area that becomes active after 1-10 rounds (caster’s choice). Whenever any creature walks within 5’ of the trap’s center after it activates, it triggers and attacks all creatures in a 30’ radius (casting check vs. Body). All creatures attacked are knocked prone, while those hit are also pushed (10 + (5 * net hits))’ away from the center of the effect. Once triggered, the enchantment ends.


Sonorous Seal
(enchantment spell, 1 minute)
Range: melee                Area of Effect: 60’ radius                Duration: 1 day
This spell enchants an area of up to 60’ radius (the caster can make it smaller if she desires). When the seal is created, the caster may exempt any number of creatures (including herself) from its effect. Any other creature that enters the area will trigger the seal, which causes a loud noise of a type chosen by the caster for 3 rounds (Difficulty: 0 on an (Alertness + Intuition) check to notice). The seal persists for its full duration, even if triggered.

Adept Incantations
Aethereal Negation
(enchantment spell, 2 AP)
Range: caster                Area of Effect: caster                Duration: (casting check) minutes
This spell allows the caster to interrupt attacks around her. Whenever a creature within 60’ of her makes an attack, she can, as a reaction, interrupt that attack and cause it to do nothing. Successfully interrupting an attack requires the caster to succeed an opposed check between her casting check and whatever skill is being used for the attack to be interrupted. Attempting to interrupt an attack costs the caster 1 AP on her next turn.


Circle Against Evil
(enchantment spell, 2 AP)
Range: melee                Area of Effect: 30’ radius                Duration: (casting check) hours
This spell protects a 30’ radius area (the caster can make it smaller if she desires); while that area is enchanted, all Unnatural creatures (Abominations, Outsiders, Undead, and Summoned creatures) that wish to enter the area must succeed a Mind vs. casting check to do so, otherwise their movement stops at the edge. Even if they succeed, they are still slowed and suffer -50% Speed while within the circle. This spell can also be cast as a ritual; if this is done, the radius is increased to 150’ (though the caster can make it smaller if she wishes) and the duration becomes permanent. However, the ritual requires 5g worth of oils and offerings to spread in the affected area.


Enervating Ward
(enchantment spell, 2 AP)
Range: melee                Area of Effect: 30’ radius                Duration: (casting check) hours
This spell lays a magical trap in a target area that becomes active after 1-10 rounds (caster’s choice). Whenever any creature walks within 5’ of the trap’s center after it activates, it triggers and attacks all creatures in a 30’ radius (casting check vs. Body). All creatures attacked are weakened, reducing damage they deal by (3 +/- net hits) and reducing their Speed by (15 +/- (5 * net hits))’. Once triggered, the enchantment ends.


Mace of Disruption
(summoning spell, 2 AP)
Range: melee        Area of Effect: single target        Duration: (casting check) minutes
This spell creates a magical Mace of disruptive magic in the hand of a touched creature. The mace has the following statistics and persists for the full duration of the spell: Attack: 3/1/0, Defense: 1, Damage: 7 (crushing), Reach: 5’, Size: S, deals +1 endurance loss on-hit. The target can use her Melee Weapons skill, or whatever skill was used to cast the spell, when attacking with the mace; its attack checks are modified by Strength or Agility (depending on how it is wielded) as normal for a 1-handed weapon. Whenever the Mace of Disruption hits a creature, it automatically removes one enchantment or spiritual effect of the wielder’s choice from them. In addition, whenever it hits any Summoned creature, it automatically deals a Deathblow to them. The wielder can sheathe and draw the sword normally; while “sheathed,” it disappears back into the aether and cannot be seen or interacted with.


Mass Dispel

Even if they succeed, they are still slowed and suffer -50% Speed while within the circle. This spell can also be cast as a ritual; if this is done, the radius is increased to 150’ (though the caster can make it smaller if she wishes) and the duration becomes permanent.

All creatures hit are imprisoned for (1 + net hits) minutes, preventing them from taking actions, taking damage, being targeted by any ability, skill, or effect, and preventing the duration of any condition, enchantment, or other effect (other than the imprisonment effect itself) affecting them from changing. Once triggered, the enchantment ends.
