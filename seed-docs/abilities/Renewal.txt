The target can use her Melee Weapons skill, or whatever skill was used to cast the spell, when attacking with the staff; its attack checks are modified by Strength as normal for a 2-handed weapon. The wielder of the Healer’s Crook can cast Renewal spells even while wielding it, gains a +2 bonus to the casting checks of these spells, and, whenever she restores endurance to a creature or heals one of their wounds, she also restores +2 endurance.
