All enchantments and </span><span class="c1 c6">spiritual </span><span class="c1">effects in the affected area are automatically destroyed (including area enchantments that only partly overlap the </span><span class="c1 c5 c4">Antimagic Field</span><span class="c1">), all temporary runes in the area are destroyed, and all permanent runes are suppressed for as long as they remain there. In addition, all checks modified by Magic within the </span><span class="c1 c5 c4">Antimagic Field </span><span class="c1">automatically fail and score 0 hits on their checks, doing nothing. Any Summoned creature within the </span><span class="c1 c4 c5">Antimagic Field</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is instantly destroyed with no check to resist, while Abominations, Constructs, Outsiders, Primordials, and Undead suffer a -4 penalty to all checks while within. No spell, ability, or other effect can increase or reduce the duration of this spell, nor can it be moved, affected, or destroyed in any way short of its effect ending naturally.</span></p><p class="c3 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c2" id="h.gdawtidav2lh"><span class="c12 c5">Chaos Storm</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c0">(cloud spell, 2 AP)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c4">Range</span><span class="c1">: 30&rsquo; increment&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c4">Area of Effect</span><span class="c1">: 10&rsquo; radius&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c4">Duration</span><span class="c0">: (casting check) rounds</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">This spell creates a whirling aethereal storm that causes chaotic harm to those within.
